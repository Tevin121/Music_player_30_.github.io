Creating a Flow Chart for Reading Variables

Counting in groups of 4, what are the choices I have, identified using modulus
(Abstract the parameters from skip-counting by 4's
- R0: 
- R1: 
- R2: 
- R3: 

---

v2: local floats as arrays, deal with row verification, observed in prototyping as an ERROR
- single degree, multiple variable polynomial

Build Procedural ERROR handling
- main div-width is given, referent is calculated
  height must be verified
- what are the numbers that should be calculated into the divs[]
** Caution: error with Row #3 from grid

---

v3: apply flow chart to coding structures in repeating groups of 4 (started counting in 4's, can count other ways

Example Coding Structures to create a flowchart

Using Ternary to populate choice of two options

Using IF-ELSEIf-ELSEIf-ELSE
- EMPTY Else containing Procedural ERROR println()

Using Even-Odd Modulus
Using Modulus of Groups of Four

Using Boolean ON-OFF in IF Statements
